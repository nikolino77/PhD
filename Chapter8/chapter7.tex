\chapter{Na-22 measurement}

In a PET system the excitation energy of the incident $\gamma$ is 511 KeV. As stated previously, at this energy a series of different processes intervene and contribute to the time resolution measured.
Three elements should be considered, when comparing time profiles to the one measured with VUV radiation:
\begin{itemize}
\item production of Cerenkov photons
\item volume excitation (and so transit time spread in the bulk)
\item de excitation down to the thermalization region
\end{itemize}
The relative strengths of these phenomena have already been compared in chapter 6, and the possibility of measuring at high energy allows to phisically quantify these effects.
In particular a TCSPC system based on a $^{22}$Na source has been implemented, using a tagging crystal and a SiPM as a start signal and a MCP-PMT as a stop signal. 

\section{Phenomenology}

The physics of $\gamma$ photon interaction have been already introduced in chapter 2.
In order to build a time correlated single photon counting experiment two time signals are necessary, a start signal and a stop signal.
A simple way to obtain this is to use a $\beta ^{+}$ active isotope, such as $^{22}$Na. This isotope emits a positron according to the decay reaction $^{22}Na \rightarrow ^{22}Ne + \beta ^{+} + \nu _{e} + \gamma$. The positron yield is relatively high, $90.4\%$, and competitive processes are electron capture (EC) and direct transition to the Ne ground state. 
In the positron emission case the Ne ground state is reached after 3.7 ps by emission of a $\gamma$ quantum of 1.274 MeV. The half life of the isotope is 2.6 years.

It is worth to note that, as outlined in chapter 2 the Cerenkov threshold for heavy scintillators is below the energy of the annihilation $\gamma$ produced by the isotope.

\label{fig:setup}
\end{figure}
The scheme of the setup is shown in figure \ref{fig:setup}.
The tagging crystal used in this configuration is a 2x2x5 mm$^{3}$ LSO:Ce,Ca pixel, readout by a SiPM board amplified by a NINO chip. 
% glue? cerca misure del mppc!
The SiPM mounted on the board is a 3x3 mm $^{2}$ Hamamatsu MPPC S10931-050P with 50 $\mu$m cell size.
Its signal is then fed in to the NINO chip described in chapter 3. The NINO technology, thanks to the time-over-threshold technique, collects time and energy information at the same time, thus allowing for a complete cut analysis.
The SiPM was biased through the board at 72.5 V, and the NINO at the nominal working voltage of 2.5 V. Moreover a potentiometer installed in the board allows to set up the lower and higher threshold for the NINO chip, as will be discussed in the following paragraph.
The signal is directly coupled to a high-bandwidth oscilloscope, able to digitize the pulses, a LeCroy DDA 735Zi (10 GS/s).
A sample of the NINO signal is shown in figure \ref{fig:NINO_sign}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\end{center}
\caption[NINO signal sample]{Example of NINO output from SiPM signal.}
\label{fig:NINO_sign}
\end{figure}
The stop signal is directly routed in to the oscilloscope without amplification. The stop detector is a Hamamatsu R3809U-50 MCP-PMT.
The signal of the MCP is very fast, as can be seen in figure \ref{fig:MCP_sign}, since it is almost completely contained in 1 ns. This allows for a multi photon detection setup.
Indeed the two signal lines from the oscilloscope were saved for offline analysis, acting as a completely digitalization of the signal.

\end{center}
\caption[MCP signal sample]{Example of Hamamatsu MCP-PMT output.}
\label{fig:MCP_sign}
\end{figure}
The components of the apparatus were placed in a cooled light-tight box, and the temperature held at 20 $^{\circ}$C with a degree tolerance.
Cooling is necessary to mantain the performance of SiPM. Indeed the number of thermal electrons that give rise to dark counts in the detector is strongly dependant on the temperature.
In the setup presented, as already pointed out, the accumulation times can be quite slow. It is necessary to keep the number of detected photon low, so that no significant bias is introduced in the measurement. The number of starts is thus much bigger than the number of stop at the acquisition. In order to gather data for a reasonable accumulation time, it is essential to reduce to the minimum the time the acquisition system (i.e. the oscilloscope) is busy.
The MCP benefits from temperature stability as well, and for the same reasons, but the noise level is negligible if compared to the SiPM.
Moreover the threshold set for the SiPM plays an important role on the DCR level of the device: in this case the DCR at 200 mV threshold is 0.88 Mcps (for complete discussion see \cite{Gundacker2014}).

\section{Preliminaries}

In order to extract the parameters leading to the determination of rise time values and to critically analyze the impulse response funciton measured, the properties of the start and stop detectors were separately measured. 
In a second phase, the impulse response function was measured, without the sample, as it is a crucial part for the iterative reconvolution routine.
Finally the bias fraction for an optimal count rate for the sample measured was assessed.

\subsection{Characteristics of the start signal}

As already outlined, the start signal originates in a tagging crystal.
The crystal is a 2x2x5 mm$^{3}$ LSO:Ce, Ca pixel, glued to the SiPM. Between 4500 and 5000 photons are collected at the photodetector, already corrected for the quantum efficiency. 
%e'vero?
The working point for the NINO chip, biased at 2.5 Volts, was set via a potentiometer on the board, at 200 mV.
% no le threshold non sono capite!
The signal is selected at the photopeak, so that the contribution from time walk is limited.
In order to estimate the contribution of the start signal to the total IRF the board was measured in CTR along with a reference board.
The setup for CTR measurement is a simple start-stop configuration with two similar boards and a $^{22}$Na source.
The reference board was measured separately and details will not be given here, for a complete discussion see \cite{Gundacker2014}. The CTR on the reference arm is $\sim$ 105 ps FWHM, measured after selection at the photopeak on both arms, as shown in figure \ref{fig:start}.
In the same figure the $^{22}$Na spectrum in LSO is shown, with the single photon signal at the beginning of the range. Non linearity due to the time over threshold technique are present, although not taken into account separately. Since the best time resolution is delivered in the photopeak region, the influence of non linearity in the energy spectrum is negligible.

\end{center}
\caption[Start characteristics]{Example of start spectrum (left) and measured CTR at the photopeak (right).}
\label{fig:start}
\end{figure}

The electronics contribution depends on the data aquistion electronics and its noise level. This contribution can be estimated as
\begin{equation}
\sigma _{noise} = \frac{RMS _{noise}}{dV/dt}
\end{equation}
where the RMS of the noise is determined from the pedestal of the signal and $dV/dt$ is the slew rate. In this case it can be estimated at 37 ps (for a complete discussion see \cite{Gundacker2014}). 

\subsection{Characteristics of the stop signal}
The stop signal is a is a Hamamatsu R3809U-50 MCP-PMT. In order to estimate the contribution of the stop signal to the total IRF the MCP time response was measured with the aid of a high resolution laser.
The setup is composed by a Picosecond Diode Laser-Pilas head and a series of optical filters to reduce the light intensity hitting the photodetector down to less than one photon per excitation. The two signal are than routed to a LeCroy Oscilloscope LeCroy DDA 735Zi (10 GS/s) and data analysis is performed offline.
In order to measure the MCP SPTR a high resolution laser is needed, matching the wavelength of emission of the scintillator measured in TCSPC, if possible. The Pilas laser delivers a 28.9 ps pulse (FWHM) at a frequency of 100 kHz and a wavelength of 419 nm. The rising edge of the laser trigger is shown in figure \ref{fig:trigger}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{../Pictures/Chapter_8/laser_trigger.png}
\end{center}
\caption[Laser trigger]{Rising edge of the laser trigger.}
\label{fig:trigger}
\end{figure}
To extract the time difference between the laser trigger and the MCP signal, an offline analysis was performed. The digitized pulses were saved and analyzed with the software package ROOT. A threshold for trigger was set at 5 mV on the MCP and the time difference was calculated in the interpolated signal. Therefore the sampling of the signal goes from 10 GS/s to 100 GS/s. 
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=7cm]{../Pictures/Chapter_8/amp_MCP.png}
\includegraphics[width=7cm]{../Pictures/Chapter_8/time_walk_mcp.png}
\end{center}
\caption[Time walk of the MCP-PMT]{Amplitude spectrum for the MCP-PMT (left) and scatter plot amplitude - delay (right).}
\label{fig:mcp_laser}
\end{figure}
As shown in figure \ref{fig:mcp_laser}, the amplitude of the MCP varies considerably on the range considered, that is between 5 mV and 50 mV, where most of the signals lie. A saturation effect due to the limited amplitude window of the oscilloscope is also present, but cut in data analysis. This variation makes the stop detector prone to important time walk. 
The possibility of storing separately the digitized pulses allow for a complete selection and correction of these events. The scatter plot in figure \ref{fig:mcp_laser_walk} is corrected through a simple time walk correction.
If we define the real time stamp brought by the signal as t$_{real}$, the threshold crossing time t$_{measured}$ and the jitter given by the time walk we can write
\begin{equation}
t_{ideal} = t_{measured} - t_{walk}
\end{equation}
and we can extract the walk correction as
\begin{equation}
t_{walk} = A + B\cdot E^{C}
\end{equation}
where E is a measure of the charge collected. In this case it will be the amplitude of the MCP-PMT signal.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=7cm]{../Pictures/Chapter_8/time_walk_corr.png}
\includegraphics[width=7cm]{../Pictures/Chapter_8/laser.png}
\end{center}
\caption[MCP corrected response (laser trigger)]{Time walk correction on the spectrum profile, MCP-PMT against laser trigger (right) and resulting corrected response (right).}
\label{fig:mcp_laser_walk}
\end{figure}
At this point the spread on the time difference spectrum shown in figure \ref{fig:mcp_laser_walk} is given by four phenomena:
\begin{itemize}
\item width of the laser signal
\item jitter on the laser trigger
\item SPTR of the detector
\item electronics noise
\end{itemize}
It is natural to consider this processes uncorrelated so to concur to the smearing of the time distribution as
\begin{equation}
\sigma _{TOT}^{2} = \sigma _{SPTR}^{2} + \sigma _{laser}^{2} + \sigma _{trigger}^{2} + \sigma _{noise}^{2} 
\end{equation}
The laser width was taken from the datasheet, and amounts to 30 ps FWHM. The laser trigger can be substantially neglected as it amounts for $\sim$ 4 ps FWHM. Given the slew rate of the signal the $\sigma _{noise}$ amounts to $\sim$ 10 ps.

The spectrum measured can be grossly modeled as a Gaussian with a tail towards high delays. 
We notice from figure \ref{fig:mcp_laser} that ion feedback modifies the signal at higher times but it is almost two order of magnitude lower than the peak, as it is expected from a Chevron configuration. Considering the Gaussian peak we find $\sigma _{TOT} =$ 25 ps, so that we can infer    $\sigma _{SPTR} = $ 18 ps, given that $\sigma _{noise}^{2}$ amounts to 10 ps and $\sigma _{laser}^{2}$ to 13 ps.

\subsection{IRF measurements}
The last step is the measurement of the impulse response function (IRF), that is global variance on the estimate of the time stamps given by the combined effect of the start and stop uncertainties. This time spectrum needs to be deconvolved from the time spectrum of the sample measured in order to extract the parameters of the fluorescence.
In order to estimate the impulse response function, the set up presented in the previuos section was used without the scintillation sample. The start signal retains the same characteristics, but the stop signal is given by a direct interaction in the MCP-PMT. This allows to disentagle the measured curve from the effect of the crystal, time constants and travel spread of the photons.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{../Pictures/Chapter_8/response_cer_10}
\end{center}
\caption[Corrected IRF]{Measured response of the stop signal (MCP) against start signal (SiPM).}
\label{fig:ceren_10}
\end{figure}

The time walk corrected time spectrum is shown in figure \ref{fig:ceren_10}. Two separable components are present, separated by $\sim$ 300 ps. %?
In this configuration, The processes that concur to the time spectrum are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Cerenkov photons produced by $\gamma$ photons impinging in the entry window of the MCP-PMT
\item direct interaction of the $\gamma$ photons in the MCP stack
\end{itemize}
The delay of the two processes is contained in a time window of $\sim$ 300 ps.
Given the large variation in the output signal of the MCP it is not possible to select event by event with a pulse shape rejection method.
Using a simple Geant4 simulation it is possible to show that Cerenkov photons produced in the window need to interact in the photocathode and then allow time for the produced photo electron to travel in the electric field to the MCP stack. On the left side of figure \ref{fig:drift} the times of Cerenkov production in the entry window and the time of a $\gamma$ photon interaction in a MCP stack is shown.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=7cm]{../Pictures/Chapter_8/interaction_time_spectrum.png}
\includegraphics[width=7cm]{../Pictures/Chapter_8/electron_drift.png}
\end{center}
\caption[Stack and Cerenkov simulation]{Time of interaction simulate for MCP stack and entry window Cerenkov photons (left) and drift time of electrons after the photocathode (right). }
\label{fig:drift}
\end{figure}
It is then necessary to add the drifting time of the electrons between the photocathode and the first MCP stack, based on the geometry of the detector. The drifting electric field by design is given by the voltage divider of the detector, and amounts to 310 kV/m.
As shown on the right side of figure \ref{fig:drift} the drifting time of the electrons matches the time difference in the two components present in the measured IRF, and small deviations can be ascribed to partial knowledge of the detector materials and geometry of the electric field in the drifting region.

This phenomenon can be experimentally shown by selectively suppress one of the two processes. The setup was then slightly changed by tilting the MCP-PMT with respect to the start-source system.

\end{center}
\caption[Setup for Cerenkov production in the window]{Setup for Cerenkvo production in window (left) and spectrum recorded (right)}
\label{fig:twist1}
\end{figure}
Then a lead screen was placed in between and two set of measurements was performed, as shown in figure \ref{fig:twist1}:
\begin{itemize}
\item a first one with the screen covering the direct line of interaction between the source and the position of the MCP stack deduced from the design of the detector
\item a second one with the screen covering the section of the entry window
\end{itemize}
It was then possible to suppress, respectively, the direct $\gamma$ interaction in the stack and the Cerenkov production in the window. The relative intensity of the two peaks is reversed, as shown in figure \ref{fig:twist2}. 
The final time resolution can be inferred from the 
last figure, since the IRF to be deconvolved is composed only by the part of the spectrum related to photo electrons. As will be explained below, the direct interaction of $\gamma$ photons in the stack brings additional spurious background to the spectrum, but it is not related to the scintillation pulse. Nevertheless the two peaks show similar width, and this is due to the fact that the resolution is dominated by the start signal, which is far worse and the slight difference given by the electron drift is negligible.
As a consequence, we cut on the Cerenkov part of the IRF spectrum, and extract the width as a $\sigma _{IRF}$ = 73 ps. This is in substantial agreement with the discussion of the previous section since $\sigma _{IRF}^{2} = \sigma _{stop}^{2} + \sigma _{start}^{2} + \sigma _{noise}^{2}$, where $\sigma _{start}$ = 62 ps, $\sigma _{noise}$ = 37 ps and $\sigma _{stop}$ = 18 ps.

\subsection{Control of the bias fraction}
The main advantage of using the available oscilloscope as a digitizer of the pulses for offline analysis is the possibility of extracting multi time stamps. This allows for a multi-hit TDC approach. 
Thanks to the fact that signals from MCP-PMT are very fast, i.e. completely contained in 1 ns, the dead time is very low and so it is the biased fraction of events. 
Starting from the considerations previously stated in chapter 6, it is possible to control this fraction by counting the number of pulses per event.
Usually the biased fraction is qualitatively controlled by calculating the geometric factor of the setup and by keeping the number of counts well below one per start signal. This was also the approach used in the case of VUV measurement, where  no multi hit TDC was available.
In the case of the $\gamma$ setup, also given the low number of counts and the difficulties in collecting a high statistics, it is necessary to keep the rate as high as possible, while still being sure not to introduce significative bias in the measurement.
In this setup it is possible to control in real time the number of pulses per event that should follow a Poisson distribution, as shown in figure \ref{fig:} for a LSO:Ce, Ca crystal. The extraction of the average allows to completely control the bias fraction, and this was done for all the samples measured.

\end{center}
\caption[Multi hits in $\gamma$ setup]{Example of multi hit event (left) and distribution of pulses over the events (right).}
\label{fig:twist1}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Background}
In the measurement campaign conducted two separate background processes intervene:
\begin{itemize}
\item random coincidences
\item direct interaction of a $\gamma$ in the detector
\end{itemize}
For what concerns random coincidencies they should be kept at a low level, in order not to worsen the uncertainty on the parameter extraction at the fit level. Indeed the important parameter is the signal to noise ratio and this aspect depends strongly on the light yield of the crystal measured, and on the geometry of the system. Nevertheless this kind of event is taken into account in the fit procedure, and in principle the only disadvantage is the necessity for higher statistics to be collected.

The direct interaction of a $\gamma$ in the detector, on the other hand, could severely bias the measurement, in the time window where the rising edge of the crystal lies. 
The active area of the MCP is quite large, given the size of the entry window, with a diameter of 11 mm. This makes direct interaction in the detector quite likely.
This is easily taken in to account in the case of 511 KeV $\gamma$, since they are emitted back to back. In this case it is sufficient to tilt the stop detector with respect to the sample to measure, with an angle of 90 $^{\circ}$C.

As previously explained, in addition to the 511 KeV $\gamma$ photons produced by the annihilation of the positron, the $^{22}$Na de-excite to the $^{22}$ Ne ground level by emitting a 1.274 MeV $\gamma$. 
The de-excitation $\gamma$ is emitted isotropically and can interact in the detector after a gate is open on the start arm, unrelated to any scintillation event in the sample.
As shown in \ref{fig:twist2} this events happen exactly on the rise time of the signal, since the delay introduced by the geometry is negligible.
It is not possible to select on a pulse shape basis since the MCP amplitude largely varies, and there is no separable difference between signals coming from a 1.274 MeV event and a photo electron event.

Thus in order to restrict the influence of this events, which become less and less problematic as light yield of the sample measured increase, two approaches are possible:
\begin{itemize}
\item screen the detector from the source
\item optically delay the scintillation light in order to easily cut spurious events from direct interaction.
\end{itemize}
The first solution was chosen for time constraints, but the optical delay will be implemented in the future. In particular 5 cm of lead blocks were positioned in between, that allow to stop 95$\%$ of the incoming $\gamma$ photons (density and stopping power taken from \cite{nist2005}). This is the case shown in figure \ref{fig:twist3} for CeF$_{3}$.

\section{Data analysis}
Due to time constraints not all the samples measured in VUV could be measured with the $\gamma$ setup, though the proof of concept was delivered for future completion of the study.
The samples measured in the $\gamma$ setup were
\begin{itemize}
\item LYSO 2737
\item LGSO
\item CTI 2408
\item CeF3
\item LSO Ca Ce
\item LuAG %?
\end{itemize}
The data extracted were analyzed offline for cuts and time walk correction. 
The rise time parameter was extracted with the iterative reconvolution algorithm presented in chapter 6, and the error was evaluated as confidence interval on the $\Delta$Likelihood.

\subsection{Cuts and background estimation}
The IRF measurement was performed at the beginning of the campaign and repeated at regular intervals to correct for eventual drifts, but no significant drift was observed.
On the data collected for offline analysis the first cut performed is the photopeak selection on the start signal, that for the NINO signal happens between 200 and 220 ns, at the 511 KeV peak of the $^{22}$Na.

For the MCP data two set of manipulations were perfomed: on the amplitude of the MCP to avoid saturation effect and for time walk correction. 
The MCP signal was cut between 10 and 40 mV, which is the interval that contains the 70$\%$ of the pulses collected. At this point the signal was corrected for time walk.

As previously explained, the background can play an important role in the measurement, especialli in the case of crystals with low or very low light yield, which is the case of CeF$_{3}$ for example. 
In order to control this a lead screen was positioned between the source and the MCP to suppress the count rate from direct interaction in the stack. Additionally a quick background measurement was performed, to ensure that the background count rate could be neglected.
